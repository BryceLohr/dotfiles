# Dotfiles

Basic `zsh` configuration.

Previously this worked with both MacOS and Linux, but I didn't update or port any of the Linux stuff after migration from `bash` to `zsh`.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
* `git` installed and credentials configured
* This repo cloned

1. `cd dotfiles`
2. `./install.sh`

## TODO

* Install/configure `zsh` completion
* Install/configure [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)
